## Introduction

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/5f0fda20e96042ceae2f98ccbb4c2e30)](https://app.codacy.com/manual/luca_6/SAMLPortal?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=Zegorax/SAMLPortal&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Settings)

SAMLPortal is a web app designed for companies using a lot of self-hosted services. It act as a SAML IdP (Identity Provider) for your apps. It also doubles as welcome portal for users by presenting apps and categories for which the user has access to.
Every app can be linked to one or more LDAP group, and can be used to initiate a SAML request. The app will only be displayed if the user is part of the LDAP group linked to it.
